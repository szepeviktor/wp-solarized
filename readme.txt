Make admin pages solarized, ease your eyes.

== Description ==
Adds an admin color scheme which not only colorizes the admin menu and
the admin bar but the whole page.

Use it if you know the admin pages, if you know the location of everything
because solarized's contrast is lower than other color schemes
to ease your eyes.

This plugin is based on [Ethan Schoonover's](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) project of the same name.
